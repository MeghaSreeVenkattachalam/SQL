Example 1:

Input: 
Triangle table:
+----+----+----+
| x  | y  | z  |
+----+----+----+
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
+----+----+----+
Output: 
+----+----+----+----------+
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
+----+----+----+----------+
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |
+----+----+----+----------+

CODE:

# Write your MySQL query statement below

SELECT X,Y,Z, CASE WHEN X+Y<=Z || Y+Z<=X || X+Z<=Y THEN 'No'
ELSE 'Yes'
END AS triangle FROM Triangle;
